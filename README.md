Abstract Interpretation in Idris
====================================

The goal of this project contained within this repository is 
for learning the more advanced features Idris (currently only version 1)
has to offer, and to play around with various forms of static analyses
which make use of the abstract interpretation framework.

This repository will be updated as the project progresses.
